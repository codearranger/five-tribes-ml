    "- 🌳 **Symbolists** - Learn through logical rules\n",
    "- 🧠 **Connectionists** - Learn by mimicking the brain\n",
    "- 🧬 **Evolutionaries** - Learn through simulated evolution\n",
    "- 📊 **Bayesians** - Learn through probabilistic inference\n",
    "- 📏 **Analogizers** - Learn by recognizing similarity\n",

    "### What You'll Learn:\n",
    "1. How different ML paradigms approach the same problem\n",
    "2. The philosophical differences between approaches\n",
    "3. When to use each type of algorithm\n",

Pedro Domingos, in his book \"The Master Algorithm,\" identifies five major \"tribes\" of machine learning, each with its own philosophy and techniques.\n\n**Why does this matter?** Because understanding these different paradigms helps you:\n- Choose the right algorithm for your problem\n- Understand why an algorithm works (or doesn't)\n- Combine approaches for better results\n- Think more deeply about what \"learning\" really means\n\nIn this notebook, we'll see how each tribe tackles the same problem: classifying iris flowers based on their physical measurements. By the end, you'll understand not just *that* different algorithms exist, but *why* they approach problems differently.",
