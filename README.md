# Five Tribes Iris Classification

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/codearranger/five-tribes-ml/blob/main/five_tribes_iris_classification.ipynb)

An educational Jupyter notebook demonstrating how the five tribes of machine learning (from Pedro Domingos' "The Master Algorithm") approach the classic Iris flower classification problem.

## Overview

This project compares five fundamental approaches to machine learning:

- 🌳 **Symbolists** (Decision Trees) - Learning through logical rules
- 🧠 **Connectionists** (Neural Networks) - Learning by mimicking the brain
- 🧬 **Evolutionaries** (Genetic Algorithms) - Learning through simulated evolution
- 📊 **Bayesians** (Naive Bayes) - Learning through probabilistic inference
- 📏 **Analogizers** (k-Nearest Neighbors) - Learning by recognizing similarity

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd masteralgorithm

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Open: five_tribes_iris_classification.ipynb
```

Or view the pre-executed notebook directly on GitHub!

## What You'll Learn

- The philosophical differences between ML paradigms
- When to use each type of algorithm
- Working implementations you can modify and experiment with
- How the same problem can be solved in fundamentally different ways

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- See `requirements.txt` for package dependencies

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by Pedro Domingos' book ["The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World"](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Algorithm-Ultimate-Learning-Machine/dp/0465065708).
